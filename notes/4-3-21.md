# Comparing GLOE-seq siRNA controls

Today I am focusing on comparing the two si-RNA control samples to identify
any major differences in the GLOE-seq replicates.

## Approach

1. Rewrite "peak calling". For simplicity planning on just calculating the mean
    peak strength (number of reads) and using reads that fall at above N
    number of standard deviations away from the min peak value (1). This should
    control if there is overall different read depth across the samples. 

2. Determine the degree of agreement between the samples. This could be done
    in a strict way by requiring exact overlaps or proximal (within a few
    bp). In this area would also want to ask

    - Are peaks generally in the same location?
    - Do overlapping peaks have generally equivalent signal?


## INCREASE ORGANIZATION and note on `include` relative paths

In order to keep things a bit better organizes I am breaking the main snakefile
up into rule files that get imported by the main snakefile. I found that
any relative filepaths in the rule files (located in the `rules` directory)
should be relative to other files as if they were in the location of the
Snakefile that is including them.

The above may not actually be true. For envs to work the path needed to be
relative to the rules directory, testing this now by running workflow.
