# Continuing work on metaplots and Okazaki fragment visualization

Like I mentioned yesterday 

## Important notes on GLOE-pipe peak calling

- Strandedness is added back in after peak calling (added this to my own pipeline
  since MACs2 assumes dsDNA interactions)
- RFD plots are not straight up plotting peaks at genomic coordinates, they
  are in fact not from called peaks at all. These plots were generated using
  deeptools taking 1000 bp windows of coverage bedgraphs and ultimately creating
  bigwig files.

## Possible alternative approach to metaplots

The R package ChIPSeeker has a lot of great built in programs for visualizing
relationships of peaks to genomic features and I think is worth using vs a
bespoke annotation type program.
