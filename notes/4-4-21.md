# Feeling the flow

Working more on the workflow today. Figured out how to run comparison
rules only for replicates, which was easier than I was making it out to be. This
just involved creating a list of tuples representing the paired samples (replicates)
and expanding these in the rule all. 

## R environment

Crick doesn't seem to have R 4.0 which was a problem in the GLOE-loops
repo and at the time of writing I had to hard code filepaths to the R
version used in the base conda env. Here I am trying to create a
distinct R env in order to avoid that.
